<title>Mountain Men</title><sub-title>Miles From Home</sub-title><desc>There are men in America who must still make their living off the land; hunting and trapping to provide for their families. They are mountain men. Their very survival is predicated on utilising ancient skills perfected over hundreds of years. This series features a variety of men from Appalachia to the Rocky Mountains to Alaska and follows them as they race against winter to obtain the sustenance and money needed to make it through the coldest months of the year. Eustace Conway lives deep in the mountains of North Carolina on the Turtle Bay Reserve. He moved here two decades ago in search of a more "truthful"existence. In the years since, he's built a home, and survived by hunting, fishing and raising animals. Tom Orr lives with his wife on the Yaak River in Montana. He is 100 miles from the nearest town, a place he hasn't ventured to in 10 years. John is a trapper by trade and to prepare for winter, he must earn enough money to obtain the supplies he needs. Marty Meierotto, his wife Dominique and their daughter Noah live in the small Alaskan town of Two Rivers. Every month, Marty pilots his bi-plane, travelling into the bush in search of the wolverine and lynx pelts he needs to make a living. While he's on the Black River, he must hunt moose and caribou to survive in the wilderness. Together, they represent America's true mountain men.</desc><date>2012</date><category>Documentary</category><category>Documentaries</category>

<title>Ice Road Truckers</title><sub-title>Load Rules</sub-title><desc>For two months out of every year, a group of exceptional men find their way to the Canadian tundra to undertake one of the most dangerous jobs on earth. In the thick of winter, truckers in giant 18 wheelers carry vital equipment and supplies to miners hundreds of miles away. In blizzard conditions, these truckers travel over ice roads that often take them over frozen lakes. Each man is trained in self survival, from fixing his truck in sub zero conditions in seconds to escaping from a truck if the ice cracks. On the other end of the journey are miners whose lives depend on the truckers making it to their base, year after year.

<title>American Hoggers</title><sub-title>To Catch A Pig</sub-title><desc>Ronnie Creek can't get his truck unstuck, or his crew to come help him - they're fed up with his obsession over an elusive 500-pound hog. So he decides that he doesn't need either to capture his prize. He takes to walking the earth with his dog Lucky in search of his White Whale, killing food and cooking it over campfires along the way. Lea and Krystal go to meet their first client, who complains of a mean mama hog he's worried will hurt his kids. The mama hog eludes the ladies, who almost lose their catch dog as well when it slips off the Jeep hood while Krystal is racing to a hog. A frustrated Robert decides to try a night hunt in a camouflage tent to see if they might be able to shoot and bag some unsuspecting hogs. Robert takes a shot and misses, thanks to Jerry distracting him. But then Jerry steps in and manages to take down the hog with one shot in the dark, and swears that he and Robert will be just fine on their own.</desc><date>2013</date><rating><value>PG</value></rating>

<title>Mountain Men</title><sub-title>Surviving Winter</sub-title><desc>There are men in America who must still make their living off the land; hunting and trapping to provide for their families. They are mountain men. Their very survival is predicated on utilising ancient skills perfected over hundreds of years. This series features a variety of men from Appalachia to the Rocky Mountains to Alaska and follows them as they race against winter to obtain the sustenance and money needed to make it through the coldest months of the year. Eustace Conway lives deep in the mountains of North Carolina on the Turtle Bay Reserve. He moved here two decades ago in search of a more "truthful"existence. In the years since, he's built a home, and survived by hunting, fishing and raising animals. Tom Orr lives with his wife on the Yaak River in Montana. He is 100 miles from the nearest town, a place he hasn't ventured to in 10 years. John is a trapper by trade and to prepare for winter, he must earn enough money to obtain the supplies he needs. Marty Meierotto, his wife Dominique and their daughter Noah live in the small Alaskan town of Two Rivers. Every month, Marty pilots his bi-plane, travelling into the bush in search of the wolverine and lynx pelts he needs to make a living. While he's on the Black River, he must hunt moose and caribou to survive in the wilderness.

<title>Mountain Men</title><sub-title>Show Me The Money</sub-title><desc>There are men in America who must still make their living off the land; hunting and trapping to provide for their families. They are mountain men. Their very survival is predicated on utilising ancient skills perfected over hundreds of years. This series features a variety of men from Appalachia to the Rocky Mountains to Alaska and follows them as they race against winter to obtain the sustenance and money needed to make it through the coldest months of the year. Eustace Conway lives deep in the mountains of North Carolina on the Turtle Bay Reserve. He moved here two decades ago in search of a more "truthful"existence. In the years since, he's built a home, and survived by hunting, fishing and raising animals. Tom Orr lives with his wife on the Yaak River in Montana. He is 100 miles from the nearest town, a place he hasn't ventured to in 10 years. John is a trapper by trade and to prepare for winter, he must earn enough money to obtain the supplies he needs. Marty Meierotto, his wife Dominique and their daughter Noah live in the small Alaskan town of Two Rivers. Every month, Marty pilots his bi-plane, travelling into the bush in search of the wolverine and lynx pelts he needs to make a living. While he's on the Black River, he must hunt moose and caribou to survive in the wilderness.

<title>I Love You, Man</title><desc>From the director of Along Came Polly comes this comical tale exploring what's at the core of male friendship and what it truly means to be a friend. Paul Rudd stars as Peter Klaven, a successful real estate agent who, upon getting engaged to the woman of his dreams, Zooey, (Rashida Jones), discovers to his dismay that he has no male friend close enough to serve as his best man. Peter immediately embarks on a series of bizarre and awkward "mandates" to find such a friend. He meets Sydney Fife (Jason Segel), a fun loving, charismatic man, Peter's opposite, with whom he instantly bonds. But the closer the two men get, the more Peter's relationship with Zooey suffers, ultimately forcing him to choose between his fiancee and his newfound friend.</desc><credits><director>John Hamburg</director><actor>Paul Rudd</actor><actor>Rashida Jones</actor><actor>Jon Favreau</actor></credits><date>2009</date><category>Comedy</category><category>Movie</category><category>Comedies</category><category>Movies</category><rating><value>MA</value></rating><star-rating><value>7/10</value></star-rating>

Marty Meierotto, his wife Dominique and their daughter Noah live in the small Alaskan town of Two Rivers. Every month, Marty pilots his bi-plane, travelling into the bush in search of the wolverine and lynx pelts he needs to make a living. While he's on the Black River, he must hunt moose and caribou to survive in the wilderness. Together, they represent America's true mountain men.</desc><date>2012</date><category>Documentary</category><category>Documentaries</category>

<title>Mountain Men</title><sub-title>Miles From Home</sub-title><desc>There are men in America who must still make their living off the land; hunting and trapping to provide for their families. They are mountain men. Their very survival is predicated on utilising ancient skills perfected over hundreds of years. This series features a variety of men from Appalachia to the Rocky Mountains to Alaska and follows them as they race against winter to obtain the sustenance and money needed to make it through the coldest months of the year. Eustace Conway lives deep in the mountains of North Carolina on the Turtle Bay Reserve. He moved here two decades ago in search of a more "truthful"existence. In the years since, he's built a home, and survived by hunting, fishing and raising animals. Tom Orr lives with his wife on the Yaak River in Montana. He is 100 miles from the nearest town, a place he hasn't ventured to in 10 years. John is a trapper by trade and to prepare for winter, he must earn enough money to obtain the supplies he needs. Marty Meierotto, his wife Dominique and their daughter Noah live in the small Alaskan town of Two Rivers. Every month, Marty pilots his bi-plane, travelling into the bush in search of the wolverine and lynx pelts he needs to make a living. While he's on the Black River, he must hunt moose and caribou to survive in the wilderness. Together, they represent America's true mountain men.</desc><date>2012</date><category>Documentary</category><category>Documentaries</category>

<title>American Hoggers</title><sub-title>Separate Ways</sub-title><desc>Krystal and Lea commit to their decision to quit Jerry and team Campbell and start their own business. They buy their own Jeep and christen it with a decal bearing the name of their new outfit: Wild Women Hoggers. Jerry and Robert struggle without the girls, losing hogs as Jerry struggles to stay on his feet. Jerry is convinced Krystal will return; Robert doubts it. The Creeks are out catching hogs and Ronnie is on board with his team - until he's convinced his dogs are on "The Big One" so he hits the road solo, ditching his crew. When Ronnie's truck gets stuck, he spots what he swears is his 500-pound hog, and radios for his crew to come help him. They've had enough of Creek's obsession and they refuse.</desc><date>2013</date><rating><value>PG</value></rating>

Eustace Conway lives deep in the mountains of North Carolina on the Turtle Bay Reserve. He moved here two decades ago in search of a more "truthful"existence.

Every month, Marty pilots his bi-plane, travelling into the bush in search of the wolverine and lynx pelts he needs to make a living.

So he decides that he doesn't need either to capture his prize. He takes to walking the earth with his dog Lucky in search of his White Whale, killing food and cooking it over campfires along the way. Lea and Krystal go to meet their first client, who complains of a mean mama hog he's worried will hurt his kids. The mama hog eludes the ladies, who almost lose their catch dog as well when it slips off the Jeep hood while Krystal is racing to a hog. A frustrated Robert decides to try a night hunt in a camouflage tent to see if they might be able to shoot and bag some unsuspecting hogs. Robert takes a shot and misses, thanks to Jerry distracting him. But then Jerry steps in and manages to take down the hog with one shot in the dark, and swears that he and Robert will be just fine on their own.</desc><date>2013</date><rating><value>PG</value></rating>

<title>Mountain Men</title><sub-title>Surviving Winter</sub-title><desc>There are men in America who must still make their living off the land; hunting and trapping to provide for their families. They are mountain men. Their very survival is predicated on utilising ancient skills perfected over hundreds of years. This series features a variety of men from Appalachia to the Rocky Mountains to Alaska and follows them as they race against winter to obtain the sustenance and money needed to make it through the coldest months of the year. Eustace Conway lives deep in the mountains of North Carolina on the Turtle Bay Reserve. He moved here two decades ago in search of a more "truthful"existence. In the years since, he's built a home, and survived by hunting, fishing and raising animals. Tom Orr lives with his wife on the Yaak River in Montana. He is 100 miles from the nearest town, a place he hasn't ventured to in 10 years. John is a trapper by trade and to prepare for winter, he must earn enough money to obtain the supplies he needs. Marty Meierotto, his wife Dominique and their daughter Noah live in the small Alaskan town of Two Rivers. Every month, Marty pilots his bi-plane, travelling into the bush in search of the wolverine and lynx pelts he needs to make a living. While he's on the Black River, he must hunt moose and caribou to survive in the wilderness. Together, they represent America's true mountain men.</desc><date>2012</date><category>Documentary</category><category>Documentaries</category>

<title>I Love You, Man</title><desc>From the director of Along Came Polly comes this comical tale exploring what's at the core of male friendship and what it truly means to be a friend. Paul Rudd stars as Peter Klaven, a successful real estate agent who, upon getting engaged to the woman of his dreams, Zooey, (Rashida Jones), discovers to his dismay that he has no male friend close enough to serve as his best man. Peter immediately embarks on a series of bizarre and awkward "mandates" to find such a friend. He meets Sydney Fife (Jason Segel), a fun loving, charismatic man, Peter's opposite, with whom he instantly bonds. But the closer the two men get, the more Peter's relationship with Zooey suffers, ultimately forcing him to choose between his fiancee and his newfound friend.</desc><credits><director>John Hamburg</director><actor>Paul Rudd</actor><actor>Rashida Jones</actor><actor>Jon Favreau</actor></credits><date>2009</date><category>Comedy</category><category>Movie</category><category>Comedies</category><category>Movies</category><rating><value>MA</value></rating><star-rating><value>7/10</value></star-rating>

<title>Mountain Men</title><sub-title>The Final Stand</sub-title><desc>There are men in America who must still make their living off the land; hunting and trapping to provide for their families. They are mountain men. Their very survival is predicated on utilising ancient skills perfected over hundreds of years. This series features a variety of men from Appalachia to the Rocky Mountains to Alaska and follows them as they race against winter to obtain the sustenance and money needed to make it through the coldest months of the year. Eustace Conway lives deep in the mountains of North Carolina on the Turtle Bay Reserve. He moved here two decades ago in search of a more "truthful"existence. In the years since, he's built a home, and survived by hunting, fishing and raising animals. Tom Orr lives with his wife on the Yaak River in Montana. He is 100 miles from the nearest town, a place he hasn't ventured to in 10 years. John is a trapper by trade and to prepare for winter, he must earn enough money to obtain the supplies he needs. Marty Meierotto, his wife Dominique and their daughter Noah live in the small Alaskan town of Two Rivers. Every month, Marty pilots his bi-plane, travelling into the bush in search of the wolverine and lynx pelts he needs to make a living. While he's on the Black River, he must hunt moose and caribou to survive in the wilderness. Together, they represent America's true mountain men.</desc><date>2012</date><category>Documentary</category><category>Documentaries</category>

<title>In The Night Garden</title><sub-title>Windy Day In The Garden</sub-title><desc>In the Night Garden is about a magical picture-book place that exists between waking and sleeping in a child's imagination. Reached by following a magical little blue star, the Night Garden is a warm and affectionate world which is home to a comical and diverse community of toys, living happily together, and who care for each other unconditionally. In the Night Garden is a thoroughly modern interpretation of a nursery rhyme picture book, and takes children on an imaginative journey to meet a host of wonderfully silly characters living together within a happy and caring community. It is both funny and reassuring, with a capacity to relax and entertain. The tone of the program is deliberately literary. Words, rhymes and music carry the viewer through a happy world of loveable characters and nursery rhyme nonsense. Filmed in real woodland, the setting is breathtaking and the program weaves together the very latest technical innovations in live-character costume technology and computer animation, to create a compelling and fully immersing experience for young viewers.</desc><category>Family</category><category>Children</category><category>Childrens Group</category><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">1.15.</episode-num><subtitles type="teletext" /><rating><value>G</value></rating>

<title>In The Night Garden</title><sub-title>Tombliboo Ooo Brings The Ball Indoors</sub-title><desc>In the Night Garden is about a magical picture-book place that exists between waking and sleeping in a child's imagination. Reached by following a magical little blue star, the Night Garden is a warm and affectionate world which is home to a comical and diverse community of toys, living happily together, and who care for each other unconditionally. In the Night Garden is a thoroughly modern interpretation of a nursery rhyme picture book, and takes children on an imaginative journey to meet a host of wonderfully silly characters living together within a happy and caring community. It is both funny and reassuring, with a capacity to relax and entertain. The tone of the program is deliberately literary. Words, rhymes and music carry the viewer through a happy world of loveable characters and nursery rhyme nonsense. Filmed in real woodland, the setting is breathtaking and the program weaves together the very latest technical innovations in live-character costume technology and computer animation, to create a compelling and fully immersing experience for young viewers.</desc><category>Family</category><category>Children</category><category>Childrens Group</category><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">1.16.</episode-num><subtitles type="teletext" /><rating><value>G</value></rating>

<title>In The Night Garden</title><sub-title>What A Funny Ninky Nonk</sub-title><desc>In the Night Garden is about a magical picture-book place that exists between waking and sleeping in a child's imagination. Reached by following a magical little blue star, the Night Garden is a warm and affectionate world which is home to a comical and diverse community of toys, living happily together, and who care for each other unconditionally. In the Night Garden is a thoroughly modern interpretation of a nursery rhyme picture book, and takes children on an imaginative journey to meet a host of wonderfully silly characters living together within a happy and caring community. It is both funny and reassuring, with a capacity to relax and entertain. The tone of the program is deliberately literary. Words, rhymes and music carry the viewer through a happy world of loveable characters and nursery rhyme nonsense. Filmed in real woodland, the setting is breathtaking and the program weaves together the very latest technical innovations in live-character costume technology and computer animation, to create a compelling and fully immersing experience for young viewers.</desc><category>Family</category><category>Children</category><category>Childrens Group</category><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">1.17.</episode-num><subtitles type="teletext" /><rating><value>G</value></rating>

<title>In The Night Garden</title><sub-title>Mr Pontipine's Moustache Flies Away</sub-title><desc>In the Night Garden is about a magical picture-book place that exists between waking and sleeping in a child's imagination. Reached by following a magical little blue star, the Night Garden is a warm and affectionate world which is home to a comical and diverse community of toys, living happily together, and who care for each other unconditionally. In the Night Garden is a thoroughly modern interpretation of a nursery rhyme picture book, and takes children on an imaginative journey to meet a host of wonderfully silly characters living together within a happy and caring community. It is both funny and reassuring, with a capacity to relax and entertain. The tone of the program is deliberately literary. Words, rhymes and music carry the viewer through a happy world of loveable characters and nursery rhyme nonsense. Filmed in real woodland, the setting is breathtaking and the program weaves together the very latest technical innovations in live-character costume technology and computer animation, to create a compelling and fully immersing experience for young viewers.</desc><category>Family</category><category>Children</category><category>Childrens Group</category><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">1.18.</episode-num><subtitles type="teletext" /><rating><value>G</value></rating>

<title>In The Night Garden</title><sub-title>Catch The Ninky Nonk, Tombliboos</sub-title><desc>In the Night Garden is about a magical picture-book place that exists between waking and sleeping in a child's imagination. Reached by following a magical little blue star, the Night Garden is a warm and affectionate world which is home to a comical and diverse community of toys, living happily together, and who care for each other unconditionally. In the Night Garden is a thoroughly modern interpretation of a nursery rhyme picture book, and takes children on an imaginative journey to meet a host of wonderfully silly characters living together within a happy and caring community. It is both funny and reassuring, with a capacity to relax and entertain. The tone of the program is deliberately literary. Words, rhymes and music carry the viewer through a happy world of loveable characters and nursery rhyme nonsense. Filmed in real woodland, the setting is breathtaking and the program weaves together the very latest technical innovations in live-character costume technology and computer animation, to create a compelling and fully immersing experience for young viewers.</desc><category>Family</category><category>Children</category><category>Childrens Group</category><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">1.20.</episode-num><subtitles type="teletext" /><rating><value>G</value></rating>

<title>In The Night Garden</title><sub-title>Hide And Seek</sub-title><desc>In the Night Garden is about a magical picture-book place that exists between waking and sleeping in a child's imagination. Reached by following a magical little blue star, the Night Garden is a warm and affectionate world which is home to a comical and diverse community of toys, living happily together, and who care for each other unconditionally. In the Night Garden is a thoroughly modern interpretation of a nursery rhyme picture book, and takes children on an imaginative journey to meet a host of wonderfully silly characters living together within a happy and caring community. It is both funny and reassuring, with a capacity to relax and entertain. The tone of the program is deliberately literary. Words, rhymes and music carry the viewer through a happy world of loveable characters and nursery rhyme nonsense. Filmed in real woodland, the setting is breathtaking and the program weaves together the very latest technical innovations in live-character costume technology and computer animation, to create a compelling and fully immersing experience for young viewers.</desc><category>Family</category><category>Children</category><category>Childrens Group</category><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">1.21.</episode-num><subtitles type="teletext" /><rating><value>G</value></rating>

<title>In The Night Garden</title><sub-title>What Loud Music, Tombliboos!</sub-title><desc>In the Night Garden is about a magical picture-book place that exists between waking and sleeping in a child's imagination. Reached by following a magical little blue star, the Night Garden is a warm and affectionate world which is home to a comical and diverse community of toys, living happily together, and who care for each other unconditionally. In the Night Garden is a thoroughly modern interpretation of a nursery rhyme picture book, and takes children on an imaginative journey to meet a host of wonderfully silly characters living together within a happy and caring community. It is both funny and reassuring, with a capacity to relax and entertain. The tone of the program is deliberately literary. Words, rhymes and music carry the viewer through a happy world of loveable characters and nursery rhyme nonsense. Filmed in real woodland, the setting is breathtaking and the program weaves together the very latest technical innovations in live-character costume technology and computer animation, to create a compelling and fully immersing experience for young viewers.</desc><category>Family</category><category>Children</category><category>Childrens Group</category><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">1.22.</episode-num><subtitles type="teletext" /><rating><value>G</value></rating>

<title>In The Night Garden</title><sub-title>Slow Down Everybody</sub-title><desc>In the Night Garden is about a magical picture-book place that exists between waking and sleeping in a child's imagination. Reached by following a magical little blue star, the Night Garden is a warm and affectionate world which is home to a comical and diverse community of toys, living happily together, and who care for each other unconditionally. In the Night Garden is a thoroughly modern interpretation of a nursery rhyme picture book, and takes children on an imaginative journey to meet a host of wonderfully silly characters living together within a happy and caring community. It is both funny and reassuring, with a capacity to relax and entertain. The tone of the program is deliberately literary. Words, rhymes and music carry the viewer through a happy world of loveable characters and nursery rhyme nonsense. Filmed in real woodland, the setting is breathtaking and the program weaves together the very latest technical innovations in live-character costume technology and computer animation, to create a compelling and fully immersing experience for young viewers.</desc><category>Family</category><category>Children</category><category>Childrens Group</category><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">1.0.</episode-num><subtitles type="teletext" /><rating><value>G</value></rating>

<title>In The Night Garden</title><sub-title>Where Can Igglepiggle Have A Rest?</sub-title><desc>In the Night Garden is about a magical picture-book place that exists between waking and sleeping in a child's imagination. Reached by following a magical little blue star, the Night Garden is a warm and affectionate world which is home to a comical and diverse community of toys, living happily together, and who care for each other unconditionally. In the Night Garden is a thoroughly modern interpretation of a nursery rhyme picture book, and takes children on an imaginative journey to meet a host of wonderfully silly characters living together within a happy and caring community. It is both funny and reassuring, with a capacity to relax and entertain. The tone of the program is deliberately literary. Words, rhymes and music carry the viewer through a happy world of loveable characters and nursery rhyme nonsense. Filmed in real woodland, the setting is breathtaking and the program weaves together the very latest technical innovations in live-character costume technology and computer animation, to create a compelling and fully immersing experience for young viewers.</desc><category>Family</category><category>Children</category><category>Childrens Group</category><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">1.23.</episode-num><subtitles type="teletext" /><rating><value>G</value></rating>

<title>Southern Justice</title><desc>90% of crimes in Sullivan County, Tennessee and Ashe County, North Carolina have something to do with alcohol or drug abuse. Suspects may commit a crime "under the influence", or the crime itself may involve buying, selling or stealing illegal substances. While methamphetamine manufacturing remains a problem for Appalachian law enforcement, the abuse, theft and sale of prescription pain-killers is now considered the number one drug-related criminal issue in the area. Prescription pain-killers are cheaper and easier to obtain by individuals "doc shopping" from both legitimate and "rogue" physicians. But now, those addicted to the drugs needing a fix or simply wanting a large supply for sale are becoming more brazen, robbing pharmacies in broad daylight. In this episode of "Southern Justice", Sullivan County, Tennessee deputies investigate the robberies of three pharmacies, in which thousands of prescription pain-killer tablets like OxyContin were stolen. Due to its street price being significantly lower than other illegal drugs, OxyContin is popular and known commonly in Appalachia as "hillbilly heroin". Surveillance video of all three crimes helps investigators focus on several suspects and ultimately results in one arrest. In Ashe County, North Carolina, alcohol-related incidents remain at the top of the most-common-crime list. And the alcohol does not necessarily come from whiskey, wine or beer. Ashe County Sheriff deputies are called to defuse a domestic disturbance when a man is allegedly drunk from consuming mouthwash containing alcohol. In a county where "everybody knows everybody", the man is belligerent with deputies and narrowly avoids arrest. But later, other deputies are called to his residence when he threatens to commit suicide.</desc><category>Reality</category><category>Reality Group</category><rating><value>M</value></rating>

Metropolitan Commander Blake makes her top priority the police shooting of an unarmed civilian, which was originally ruled a lawful shooting. Blake is horrified to discover that the book on rehabilitation James Lampton an ex-prisoner wrote, and to which she agreed to write the foreword, is now rapidly climbing the best seller list. Furious, Blake is determined to distance herself from any potentially damaging association with the convicted killer. Circumstances force Blake and ex-killer Lampton together very publicly, and the rumours abound.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">0.0.</episode-num><rating><value>M</value></rating><star-rating><value>0/10</value></star-rating>

<title>Southern Justice</title><desc>90% of crimes in Sullivan County, Tennessee and Ashe County, North Carolina have something to do with alcohol or drug abuse. Suspects may commit a crime "under the influence", or the crime itself may involve buying, selling or stealing illegal substances. While methamphetamine manufacturing remains a problem for Appalachian law enforcement, the abuse, theft and sale of prescription pain-killers is now considered the number one drug-related criminal issue in the area. Prescription pain-killers are cheaper and easier to obtain by individuals "doc shopping" from both legitimate and "rogue" physicians. But now, those addicted to the drugs needing a fix or simply wanting a large supply for sale are becoming more brazen, robbing pharmacies in broad daylight. In this episode of "Southern Justice", Sullivan County, Tennessee deputies investigate the robberies of three pharmacies, in which thousands of prescription pain-killer tablets like OxyContin were stolen. Due to its street price being significantly lower than other illegal drugs, OxyContin is popular and known commonly in Appalachia as "hillbilly heroin". Surveillance video of all three crimes helps investigators focus on several suspects and ultimately results in one arrest. In Ashe County, North Carolina, alcohol-related incidents remain at the top of the most-common-crime list. And the alcohol does not necessarily come from whiskey, wine or beer. Ashe County Sheriff deputies are called to defuse a domestic disturbance when a man is allegedly drunk from consuming mouthwash containing alcohol. In a county where "everybody knows everybody", the man is belligerent with deputies and narrowly avoids arrest. But later, other deputies are called to his residence when he threatens to commit suicide.</desc><category>Reality</category><category>Reality Group</category><rating><value>M</value></rating>

<title>First Australians</title><sub-title>They Have Come To Stay</sub-title><desc>First Australians chronicles the birth of contemporary Australia as never told before, from the perspective of its first people. The series explores what unfolds when the oldest living culture in the world is overrun by the world's greatest empire. Over seven episodes, First Australians depicts the true stories of individuals - both black and white - caught in an epic drama of friendship, revenge, loss and victory in Australia's most transformative period of history. The story begins in 1788 in Sydney, with the friendship between an Englishmen (Governor Phillip) and a warrior (Bennelong) and ends in 1993 with Koiki Mabo's legal challenge to the foundation of Australia. First Australians chronicles the collision of two worlds and the genesis of a new nation. In the first episode, the first Australians and the powerful British Empire come face to face. Friendships quickly form despite immense differences, but within three years both sides are locked in a battle for land and survival.

The struggle for land rights continues to this day and one of its heroes is Eddie Koiki Mabo. Eddie Koiki Mabo fights for Australian law to recognise that his people own Murray Island, where they have lived for generations. In 1992, six months after his death and a decade after the statement of claim was first lodged in Queensland, the highest court in the land decides in Mabo's favour. The outcome overturns the notion of terra nullius, that is, the notion that the land belonged to no-one at the time of white settlement.

<title>First Australians</title><sub-title>They Have Come To Stay</sub-title><desc>First Australians chronicles the birth of contemporary Australia as never told before, from the perspective of its first people. The series explores what unfolds when the oldest living culture in the world is overrun by the world's greatest empire. Over seven episodes, First Australians depicts the true stories of individuals - both black and white - caught in an epic drama of friendship, revenge, loss and victory in Australia's most transformative period of history. The story begins in 1788 in Sydney, with the friendship between an Englishmen (Governor Phillip) and a warrior (Bennelong) and ends in 1993 with Koiki Mabo's legal challenge to the foundation of Australia. First Australians chronicles the collision of two worlds and the genesis of a new nation. In the first episode, the first Australians and the powerful British Empire come face to face. Friendships quickly form despite immense differences, but within three years both sides are locked in a battle for land and survival.

Esteban, a young boy, is told that he was saved by Mendoza, a navigator on a Spanish ship, from a ship wreck in a storm at sea. The only clue to his identity is a medal that Esteban wears about his neck. Esteban joins Mendoza on a trip from Spain to the new world - the Americas - where en route he meets two other children - Zia, an Inca girl, and Tao, the last member of a highly advanced race. All three are looking for different things - Esteban, to find his father and his identity; Zia, for her father; and Tao, for remains of his race. The clues for all three quests, however, all point to the seven Cities of Gold and so the children, Mendoza, Sancho and Pedro - two other sailors and friends of Mendoza start searching in a massive treasure hunt for the Cities Of Gold.</desc><category>Children</category><category>Childrens Group</category><rating><value>G</value></rating>

<title>Defining Moments</title><sub-title>Earth Family</sub-title><desc>Earth Family is a story about two women, a handful of Aboriginal Elders and a group of migrant youth. Its a story about how Acceptance and Respect played a vital role in healing the human Spirit. When singer songwriter Kerrianne Cox and Theatre Director / writer Cymbeline Buhler met they devised a project that would be both an empowering tool and a Life changing experience for all involved. Cymbeline runs the Western Edge Youth group in Melbourne. The young people she works with come from migrant families who have face their own issues. Many who come from war torn poverty stricken Countries and have never been outside of Victoria. Western Edge uses Arts as a way of dealing with their trauma. The plan was to take this Melbourne based youth group to the remote Beagle Bay in Kimberley's to meet with Community Elders. From listening to the Elders stories they would learn part of their history then under the Elders guidance produce a theatre play. They young people themselves would perform the play which tells of the impact of colonization on the Beagle Bay Community. The youth would perform the play twice, once in the small Beagle Bay Community and again in Broome to the general public. This documentary is a powerful example of how People from different cultural backgrounds and different generations can come together and connect in meaningful way to create change both in the wider Community and within themselves.</desc><category>Documentary</category><category>Documentaries</category><rating><value>PG</value></rating>

He takes us on a journey through this five-star constellation's astronomical, colonial and Indigenous history to the present day. For Aboriginal people the meaning of this heavenly body is deeply spiritual. By contrast, the star-adorned Eureka Flag was emblematic of protest and defiance, a quality that caused it to be adopted by activists, and lately, the darker side of Australian nationalism.</desc><rating><value>M</value></rating>

<title>Ningla A-na</title><desc>A rare addition to the study of Australian History. Made in 1972, this documentary records the events surrounding the establishment of the Aboriginal tent embassy on the lawns of Parliament House. It incorporates interviews with black activists, the work of the National Black Theatre, Aboriginal Legal Service and Aboriginal Medical Service, plus footage from the demonstrations and arrests at the embassy. This is the only film to focus on the tent embassy and is an historic document, integral to comprehension of the Aboriginal political struggle. Erection of the tent embassy on the lawns of Parliament is the most symbolic action ever taken by Aboriginal people in their struggle for justice in their own land. Ningla A-Na presents an inside view of Aboriginal political life. A film which should be seen by all Australians.</desc><rating><value>M</value></rating>

<title>Get Smart</title><desc>When the headquarters of secret U.S. spy agency CONTROL is attacked and the identities of its agents compromised, the Chief (Alan Arkin) has no choice but to promote his ever-eager analyst Maxwell Smart (Steve Carell), who has always dreamt of working in the field alongside his idol, stalwart superstar Agent 23 (Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson). Smart is partnered instead with the only other agent whose identity has not been compromised: the lovely-but-lethal veteran Agent 99 (Anne Hathaway). As Smart and 99 get closer to unraveling KAOS' master plan-and each other-they discover that key KAOS operative Siegfried (Terence Stamp) and his sidekick, Shtarker (Ken Davitian), are scheming to cash in with their network of terror. With no field experience and little time, Smart-armed with nothing but a few spy-tech gadgets and his unbridled enthusiasm-must defeat KAOS if he is to save the day.</desc><credits><director>Peter Segal</director><actor>Anne Hathaway</actor><actor>Terence Stamp</actor></credits><date>2008</date><category>Action</category><category>Action and Adventure</category><category>Movie</category><category>Movies</category><rating><value>PG</value></rating><star-rating><value>8/10</value></star-rating>

<title>Once Upon A Time In The West</title><desc>The railroad is pushing deep into the Western wilderness and Brett McBain knows the route it will have to follow. He buys up this useless desert land, builds a ranch and waits for his new wife, Jill, whom he secretly married in New Orleans. But Frank, a brutal gunman working for the railroad also sees the value of the land and an easy way to get it. Jill arrives to find a burial service in progress for her husband, and the townspeople hunting for Cheyenne, suspected of the murder. Also arriving is The Man, whose reputation with a gun has preceded him. The Man always keeps himself between Jill and Frank, and keeps them both alive. It is only when the land deed is safely in Jill's hands that Frank learns who The Man is : the younger brother of a cowboy that Frank murdered years ago.</desc><credits><director>Sergio Leone</director><actor>Henry Fonda</actor><actor>Claudia Cardinale</actor><actor>Jason Robards</actor><actor>Charles Bronson</actor></credits><date>1968</date><category>Western</category><category>Movie</category><category>Westerns</category><category>Movies</category><rating><value>M</value></rating><star-rating><value>8/10</value></star-rating>

<title>Made In Italy With Silvia Colloca</title><desc>Silvia Colloca, actress, opera singer and author of hit cookbook Silvias Cucina, serves up an Italy rarely seen by tourists during a culinary celebrazione. In this sumptuous and picturesque new series, Silvia takes a journey back to her homeland to introduce her family and present her love of healthy, hearty Italian fare. In the first episode, Silvia Colloca travels through Central Italy on a culinary celebration of traditional Italian cuisine. Her breath is taken away by stunning seaside dining on the Adriatic sea, where she learns how to make zuppa di cozze (mussles in white wine broth) on a bygone fishing pier called a Trabocco. Heading inland to her family home in Torricella, Silvia calls upon locally produced white wine to create a superbly simple dish, pollo in potacchio (chicken in a pot).

<title>Poh's Kitchen</title><desc>Poh Ling Yeow, the cook who won the hearts of the nation as runner-up on MasterChef, joins ABC TV with her very own cooking program, Poh's Kitchen. A successful artist, Poh is only a recent convert to cooking but she's taken to it like a duck to water, using her great natural aptitude and an unquenchable thirst for knowledge.  Some people find cooking quite stressful and a chore to be avoided at all costs : not Poh! For Poh, cooking is all about nurturing and sharing, and she loves inviting friends into her kitchen to help refine her unique cooking style. As she says "I love to experiment but you have to know the rules before you can bend them". And who better to help with the rules than Australia's best cooks and chefs.  This week, Poh catches up with Emmanuel Mollois, a pastry chef trained in Paris who proudly carries forward the torch of tradition. Emmanuel is highly amused by Poh's 'wild' approach as they both prepare delicious desserts they remember loving as kids in Malaysia and France.  Poh shows Emmanuel a chiffon cake which is popular throughout SE Asia. In Poh style, she adapts the recipe for modern Australia and creates an orange chiffon cake with chocolate ganache icing and hazelnuts: a unique creation. Emmanuel loves the culture he grew up in and he keeps French culinary traditions alive by running a Parisian-style cafe and patisserie in Perth. As a child he adored almond croissants from the shop next to the cinema. Now he makes his own, and he's kind enough to share his secrets - in Poh's Kitchen.

<title>Human Planet</title><desc>Narrated by John Hurt and following in the footsteps of Planet Earth and Life, this epic eight-part blockbuster is a breathtaking celebration of the amazing, complex, profound and sometimes challenging relationship between humankind and nature. Humans are the ultimate animals - the most successful species on the planet. From the frozen Arctic to steamy rainforests, from tiny islands in vast oceans to parched deserts, people have found remarkable ways to adapt and survive in the harshest environments imaginable. We've done this by harnessing our immense courage and ingenuity; learning to live with and utilise the other creatures that share these wild places. Human Planet weaves together eight inspiring episodes, set to a globally-influenced soundtrack by award-winning composer Nitin Sawhney. Each week the series focuses on a particular habitat and reveals how its people have created astonishing solutions in the face of extreme adversity. In episode one - Arctic, the temperature is sixty degrees below zero. It is the harshest environment on Earth, yet four million people manage to survive in the Arctic. This film follows a year in the human freezer. In the final episode we visit the urban jungle, where most of us now live, and discover why here the connection between humanity and nature is the most vital of all.</desc><category>Documentary</category><category>Documentaries</category>

<title>Secrets Of Tutankhamun's Treasures</title><desc>There's more to Tutankhamun's iconic treasures than meets the eye. New evidence suggests the tomb's stunning contents were meant for someone else. But who is more deserving of such opulence than Egypt's most famous king? Tutankhamun's legendary death mask is arguably the greatest treasure in history, found on the head of the king's mummified remains. Yet the mask betrays more than the king's wealth. Discrepancies between the mask and the head piece have led Egyptologist Nicholas Reeves at the University of Arizona to theorise that the mask wasn't intended for Tutakhamun, but remodelled for him. The presence of earring holes suggests it was originally intended for a woman. Now it's time to put this theory to the test.</desc><rating><value>M</value></rating>

After their wedding takes place, Justine (Kirsten Dunst) and Michael (Alexander Skarsgard) arrive at the beautiful reception provided by Justine's sister Claire (Charlotte Gainsbourg) and her husband John (Kiefer Sutherland) at their country estate. With some underlying tensions surrounding the evening, Justine does not seem to enjoy herself, and her behaviour becomes somewhat detached and erratic. Looking at the night sky with her brother-in-law, Justine is intrigued by a bright star which John identifies as the planet Antares, but in the days to come, they learn that Antares was hiding the presence of Melancholia, a large planet which is heading very near to Earth. After the wedding, Justine goes into a depression, and is cared for by Claire, who now believes that Earth is about to be destroyed by Melancholia, but despite her mental state, it is Justine who reacts with calm to the possibility of imminent disaster.</desc><credits><director>Lars Von Trier</director><actor>Kirsten Dunst</actor><actor>Charlotte Gainsbourg</actor><actor>Alexander Skarsgard</actor><actor>Stellan Skarsgard</actor></credits><date>2011</date><category>Science Fiction</category><category>Horror</category><category>Movie</category><category>Movies</category><rating><value>M</value></rating><star-rating><value>6/10</value></star-rating>

<title>Long Story Short</title><desc>This latest film from Academy Award-nominated director Christine Choy, tells the story of Larry and Trudy Long, a popular husband-and-wife nightclub act of the 40s and 50s.  Narrated and framed by the experiences of their daughter, actress Jodi Long, this film traces the couple's rise from the Chinatown nightclub circuit to a coveted appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show. Known as 'The Leongs',, they performed a mix of tap dancing, witty repartee and 'Chinaman' caricatures that both played to and undermined the racist attitudes of the day.  The limitations facing Asian American performers became even more obvious when Larry lost a rare opportunity to play a major role in the premiere Broadway production of Flower Drum Song, the first musical with an all-Asian cast. Although he later performed in travelling companies of Flower Drum Song, he never made it back to Broadway, a failure from which his career never fully recovered.  Redemption of a complicated sort comes when daughter Jodi is cast on Broadway in a revival of the same musical, re-written by Chinese American playwright David Henry Hwang, and her parents find themselves revisiting a past they thought they had buried long ago. Combining a family story with show business history and the ravages of racism, it is a story of pain, passion and perseverance.</desc><credits><director>Christine Choy</director><actor>Jodi Long (Narrator)</actor></credits><category>Biography</category><category>Art</category><category>Documentaries</category><category>Arts and Living</category><rating><value>PG</value></rating>

Historian Dr Michael Scott joins a team of international archaeologists to unlock the skeletons' secrets, using DNA mapping and cutting-edge archaeology to solve the mystery of who these men and women were and how they died.

<title>The Truth About Your Health</title><desc>Health law professor, writer and debunker-extraordinaire, Timothy Caulfield, dives deep into the science, and the social issues behind today's cutting-edge health trends in order to separate the truly good advice from the excess of high-priced placebos. What does it take to flush all the bad stuff from your body after a week-long bender? Or after several years of eating junk food? Detoxing isn't actually a thing, but it's a fixation of the Western world. Stemming from the guilty pleasures of overindulgence and under-exercising, a belief has emerged that we must regularly rid our bodies of toxins via detoxifying diets, fasts, technologies, and more. The evidence - or the lack thereof - behind this popular trend is uncovered. The science, the risks, and the underlying beliefs and fears are explored.</desc><rating><value>M</value></rating>

<title>Ningla A-na</title><desc>A rare addition to the study of Australian History. Made in 1972, this documentary records the events surrounding the establishment of the Aboriginal tent embassy on the lawns of Parliament House. It incorporates interviews with black activists, the work of the National Black Theatre, Aboriginal Legal Service and Aboriginal Medical Service, plus footage from the demonstrations and arrests at the embassy. This is the only film to focus on the tent embassy and is an historic document, integral to comprehension of the Aboriginal political struggle. Erection of the tent embassy on the lawns of Parliament is the most symbolic action ever taken by Aboriginal people in their struggle for justice in their own land. Ningla A-Na presents an inside view of Aboriginal political life. A film which should be seen by all Australians.</desc><rating><value>M</value></rating>

<title>Vote Yes For Aborigines</title><desc>On this day 40 years ago, with the highest "yes" vote in Australia's history, 90.77% of voters agreed that Aborigines be counted in the census and that the Commonwealth Government take charge of Aboriginal affairs, effectively acknowledging Aboriginal people as citizens within their own country. When the British government colonised Australia, they completely ignored the original inhabitants, declaring the land empty of people - terra nullius. From then on, Aborigines were treated as non-citizens and denied the rights that others enjoyed. While many people believe that the 1967 Referendum gave Aborigines the right to vote, it in fact removed two sections of the constitution which discriminated against Aborigines.

<title>Human Planet</title><desc>Narrated by John Hurt and following in the footsteps of Planet Earth and Life, this epic eight-part blockbuster is a breathtaking celebration of the amazing, complex, profound and sometimes challenging relationship between humankind and nature. Humans are the ultimate animals - the most successful species on the planet. From the frozen Arctic to steamy rainforests, from tiny islands in vast oceans to parched deserts, people have found remarkable ways to adapt and survive in the harshest environments imaginable. We've done this by harnessing our immense courage and ingenuity; learning to live with and utilise the other creatures that share these wild places. Human Planet weaves together eight inspiring episodes, set to a globally-influenced soundtrack by award-winning composer Nitin Sawhney. Each week the series focuses on a particular habitat and reveals how its people have created astonishing solutions in the face of extreme adversity. In episode one - Arctic, the temperature is sixty degrees below zero. It is the harshest environment on Earth, yet four million people manage to survive in the Arctic. This film follows a year in the human freezer. In the final episode we visit the urban jungle, where most of us now live, and discover why here the connection between humanity and nature is the most vital of all.</desc><category>Documentary</category><category>Documentaries</category>

<title>Made In Italy With Silvia Colloca</title><desc>Silvia Colloca, actress, opera singer and author of hit cookbook Silvias Cucina, serves up an Italy rarely seen by tourists during a culinary celebrazione. In this sumptuous and picturesque new series, Silvia takes a journey back to her homeland to introduce her family and present her love of healthy, hearty Italian fare. In the first episode, Silvia Colloca travels through Central Italy on a culinary celebration of traditional Italian cuisine. Her breath is taken away by stunning seaside dining on the Adriatic sea, where she learns how to make zuppa di cozze (mussles in white wine broth) on a bygone fishing pier called a Trabocco. Heading inland to her family home in Torricella, Silvia calls upon locally produced white wine to create a superbly simple dish, pollo in potacchio (chicken in a pot).

<title>Poh's Kitchen</title><desc>Poh Ling Yeow, the cook who won the hearts of the nation as runner-up on MasterChef, joins ABC TV with her very own cooking program, Poh's Kitchen. A successful artist, Poh is only a recent convert to cooking but she's taken to it like a duck to water, using her great natural aptitude and an unquenchable thirst for knowledge.  Some people find cooking quite stressful and a chore to be avoided at all costs : not Poh! For Poh, cooking is all about nurturing and sharing, and she loves inviting friends into her kitchen to help refine her unique cooking style. As she says "I love to experiment but you have to know the rules before you can bend them". And who better to help with the rules than Australia's best cooks and chefs.  This week, Poh catches up with Emmanuel Mollois, a pastry chef trained in Paris who proudly carries forward the torch of tradition. Emmanuel is highly amused by Poh's 'wild' approach as they both prepare delicious desserts they remember loving as kids in Malaysia and France.  Poh shows Emmanuel a chiffon cake which is popular throughout SE Asia. In Poh style, she adapts the recipe for modern Australia and creates an orange chiffon cake with chocolate ganache icing and hazelnuts: a unique creation. Emmanuel loves the culture he grew up in and he keeps French culinary traditions alive by running a Parisian-style cafe and patisserie in Perth. As a child he adored almond croissants from the shop next to the cinema. Now he makes his own, and he's kind enough to share his secrets - in Poh's Kitchen.

And he thinks he's found the answer - the ancient idea of fasting. Could the powerful new science behind this idea lead to a longer, healthier life? Mosley thinks he's found a way of fasting that still allows him to enjoy his food. It sounds too good to be true. So he decides to take a road trip across the US to investigate how a little hunger can make you younger, and of course, to try out some of this new science for himself.

<title>Secrets Of Tutankhamun's Treasures</title><desc>There's more to Tutankhamun's iconic treasures than meets the eye. New evidence suggests the tomb's stunning contents were meant for someone else. But who is more deserving of such opulence than Egypt's most famous king? Tutankhamun's legendary death mask is arguably the greatest treasure in history, found on the head of the king's mummified remains. Yet the mask betrays more than the king's wealth. Discrepancies between the mask and the head piece have led Egyptologist Nicholas Reeves at the University of Arizona to theorise that the mask wasn't intended for Tutakhamun, but remodelled for him. The presence of earring holes suggests it was originally intended for a woman. Now it's time to put this theory to the test.</desc><rating><value>M</value></rating>

Looking at the night sky with her brother-in-law, Justine is intrigued by a bright star which John identifies as the planet Antares, but in the days to come, they learn that Antares was hiding the presence of Melancholia, a large planet which is heading very near to Earth. After the wedding, Justine goes into a depression, and is cared for by Claire, who now believes that Earth is about to be destroyed by Melancholia, but despite her mental state, it is Justine who reacts with calm to the possibility of imminent disaster.</desc><credits><director>Lars Von Trier</director><actor>Kirsten Dunst</actor><actor>Charlotte Gainsbourg</actor><actor>Alexander Skarsgard</actor><actor>Stellan Skarsgard</actor></credits><date>2011</date><category>Science Fiction</category><category>Horror</category><category>Movie</category><category>Movies</category><rating><value>M</value></rating><star-rating><value>6/10</value></star-rating>

<title>Night Will Fall</title><desc>Night will Fall tells the story of the liberation of the Nazi Concentration camps. Using remarkable archive footage and testimony from both survivors and liberators, it reveals the efforts made to document the almost unbelievable scenes that the allies encountered on Liberation. The film explores how a team of top filmmakers, including Sidney Bernstein, Richard Crossman and Alfred Hitchcock came together to make a film to provide undeniable evidence of what the allies found. Each new generation deserves access to this evidence.

<title>Long Story Short</title><desc>This latest film from Academy Award-nominated director Christine Choy, tells the story of Larry and Trudy Long, a popular husband-and-wife nightclub act of the 40s and 50s.  Narrated and framed by the experiences of their daughter, actress Jodi Long, this film traces the couple's rise from the Chinatown nightclub circuit to a coveted appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show. Known as 'The Leongs',, they performed a mix of tap dancing, witty repartee and 'Chinaman' caricatures that both played to and undermined the racist attitudes of the day.  The limitations facing Asian American performers became even more obvious when Larry lost a rare opportunity to play a major role in the premiere Broadway production of Flower Drum Song, the first musical with an all-Asian cast. Although he later performed in travelling companies of Flower Drum Song, he never made it back to Broadway, a failure from which his career never fully recovered.  Redemption of a complicated sort comes when daughter Jodi is cast on Broadway in a revival of the same musical, re-written by Chinese American playwright David Henry Hwang, and her parents find themselves revisiting a past they thought they had buried long ago. Combining a family story with show business history and the ravages of racism, it is a story of pain, passion and perseverance.</desc><credits><director>Christine Choy</director><actor>Jodi Long (Narrator)</actor></credits><category>Biography</category><category>Art</category><category>Documentaries</category><category>Arts and Living</category><rating><value>PG</value></rating>

<title>The Truth About Your Health</title><desc>Health law professor, writer and debunker-extraordinaire, Timothy Caulfield, dives deep into the science, and the social issues behind today's cutting-edge health trends in order to separate the truly good advice from the excess of high-priced placebos. What does it take to flush all the bad stuff from your body after a week-long bender? Or after several years of eating junk food? Detoxing isn't actually a thing, but it's a fixation of the Western world. Stemming from the guilty pleasures of overindulgence and under-exercising, a belief has emerged that we must regularly rid our bodies of toxins via detoxifying diets, fasts, technologies, and more. The evidence - or the lack thereof - behind this popular trend is uncovered. The science, the risks, and the underlying beliefs and fears are explored.</desc><rating><value>M</value></rating>

<title>Chance</title><desc>Hugh Laurie stars as Eldon Chance, a San Francisco-based forensic neuropsychiatrist in this provocative psychological thriller based on the novel by Kem Nunn.

In over his head, Chance's descent into the city's shadowy underbelly, all the while navigating the waters of a contentious divorce and the tribulations of his teenage daughter, soon spirals into an ever-deepening exploration of one of mankind's final frontiers - the shadowy, undiscovered country of the human mind.</desc><rating><value>MA</value></rating>

<title>Ningla A-na</title><desc>A rare addition to the study of Australian History. Made in 1972, this documentary records the events surrounding the establishment of the Aboriginal tent embassy on the lawns of Parliament House. It incorporates interviews with black activists, the work of the National Black Theatre, Aboriginal Legal Service and Aboriginal Medical Service, plus footage from the demonstrations and arrests at the embassy. This is the only film to focus on the tent embassy and is an historic document, integral to comprehension of the Aboriginal political struggle. Erection of the tent embassy on the lawns of Parliament is the most symbolic action ever taken by Aboriginal people in their struggle for justice in their own land. Ningla A-Na presents an inside view of Aboriginal political life. A film which should be seen by all Australians.</desc><rating><value>M</value></rating>

<title>Vote Yes For Aborigines</title><desc>On this day 40 years ago, with the highest "yes" vote in Australia's history, 90.77% of voters agreed that Aborigines be counted in the census and that the Commonwealth Government take charge of Aboriginal affairs, effectively acknowledging Aboriginal people as citizens within their own country. When the British government colonised Australia, they completely ignored the original inhabitants, declaring the land empty of people - terra nullius. From then on, Aborigines were treated as non-citizens and denied the rights that others enjoyed. While many people believe that the 1967 Referendum gave Aborigines the right to vote, it in fact removed two sections of the constitution which discriminated against Aborigines.

<title>Human Planet</title><desc>Narrated by John Hurt and following in the footsteps of Planet Earth and Life, this epic eight-part blockbuster is a breathtaking celebration of the amazing, complex, profound and sometimes challenging relationship between humankind and nature. Humans are the ultimate animals - the most successful species on the planet. From the frozen Arctic to steamy rainforests, from tiny islands in vast oceans to parched deserts, people have found remarkable ways to adapt and survive in the harshest environments imaginable. We've done this by harnessing our immense courage and ingenuity; learning to live with and utilise the other creatures that share these wild places. Human Planet weaves together eight inspiring episodes, set to a globally-influenced soundtrack by award-winning composer Nitin Sawhney. Each week the series focuses on a particular habitat and reveals how its people have created astonishing solutions in the face of extreme adversity. In episode one - Arctic, the temperature is sixty degrees below zero. It is the harshest environment on Earth, yet four million people manage to survive in the Arctic. This film follows a year in the human freezer. In the final episode we visit the urban jungle, where most of us now live, and discover why here the connection between humanity and nature is the most vital of all.</desc><category>Documentary</category><category>Documentaries</category>

<title>Suicide Forest</title><desc>The Aokigahara Forest is a lonely place to die. So dense is the vegetation at the foot of Japan's Mount Fuji, it's all too easy to disappear among the evergreens and never be seen again. Each year the authorities remove as many as 100 bodies found in the forest. After the novel 'Kuroi Jukai' was published, in which a young lover takes their own life in the woods, it led to increased suicide rates. The site holds so many bodies that the Yakuza pays homeless people to sneak into the forest and rob the corpses. Authorities sweep for bodies only on an annual basis, as the forest sits at the base of Mount Fuji and is too dense to patrol more frequently. The Japanese government has also installed signs throughout the forest to help people seek support to address this.</desc><rating><value>M</value></rating>

<title>Betrayal!</title><desc>Betrayal! uncovers treachery...at its best. Step into a secret world of men and women who betray their families, friends and nations for money, sex, ego or principle. For these people, the stakes are often greater than life itself, and the game is won by doing whatever it takes. Betrayal! features exclusive interviews with key players in the drama - some of whom are telling their stories for the first time. Shot in a seductive film noir style, this series takes us from Moscow to Washington to London to Tel Aviv, revealing the deadliest and most alluring stories of 20th Century treason. Dr Gerald Vincent Bull was one of the world's foremost experts on ballistics and weapons systems, until his lifeless body was discovered on the doorstep of his Brussels apartment. Prior to his murder, this Canadian scientist was contracted by the government of Saddam Hussein to build an extraordinary artillery piece known as the "supergun". His assassination sparked a murder mystery that remains unsolved to this day. For the first time, intelligence operatives connected to the case, including Saddam Hussein's spy chief, emerge from the shadow's the shed light on the conflicting theories surrounding Gerald Bull's death. Was it the work of Israel's legendary Mossad, bent on destroying a doomsday weapon that could unleash Armageddon, or a sinister American plot to silence a maverick who was about to reveal his secrets to the world?</desc><category>Historical</category><category>Documentaries</category><rating><value>M</value></rating>

<title>Betrayal!</title><desc>Betrayal! uncovers treachery...at its best. Step into a secret world of men and women who betray their families, friends and nations for money, sex, ego or principle. For these people, the stakes are often greater than life itself, and the game is won by doing whatever it takes. Betrayal! features exclusive interviews with key players in the drama - some of whom are telling their stories for the first time. Shot in a seductive film noir style, this series takes us from Moscow to Washington to London to Tel Aviv, revealing the deadliest and most alluring stories of 20th Century treason. Dr Gerald Vincent Bull was one of the world's foremost experts on ballistics and weapons systems, until his lifeless body was discovered on the doorstep of his Brussels apartment. Prior to his murder, this Canadian scientist was contracted by the government of Saddam Hussein to build an extraordinary artillery piece known as the "supergun". His assassination sparked a murder mystery that remains unsolved to this day. For the first time, intelligence operatives connected to the case, including Saddam Hussein's spy chief, emerge from the shadow's the shed light on the conflicting theories surrounding Gerald Bull's death. Was it the work of Israel's legendary Mossad, bent on destroying a doomsday weapon that could unleash Armageddon, or a sinister American plot to silence a maverick who was about to reveal his secrets to the world?</desc><category>Historical</category><category>Documentaries</category><rating><value>M</value></rating>
